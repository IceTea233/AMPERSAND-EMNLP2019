So many beautiful, hard, wonderful, life-changing experiences I've had because of friendships with women.	It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.	0	22
The fact that it's underrated largely stems from the fact that by today's measure it's far from a children's movie, which unfortunately in western countries is generally the target demographic for animated features.	Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.	1	5
This is the best argument I've seen here	You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state	1	3
In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we're more lenient on violence than sex.	CMV: Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering	0	45
If so, how big are we talking?	If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2.	0	29
Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons	The only way your argument holds is if an extremely high percentage of these potential kids would have been unproductive members of society (if they were criminals, sucked up resources, drained society, etc)	0	13
3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.	A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world.	0	12

I don't disagree	The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective.	1	2
Another common one I grew up with was the "Free Parking" rule addition, where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward, which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt, dragging out the game.	there is very little skill involved in playing the game	0	16

Believing your country is better than all others is not the same as believing your country's people are better than all others.	CMV:Patriotism is the belief that being born on one side of a line makes you better.	0	26
Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous.	To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations.	1	12

IMO, the extended cuts seriously throw off the pacing of the films.	CMV: The theatrical cuts of Lord of the Rings are superior to the extended cuts and should be considered the definitive versions.	1	4
The best way to do that is to hire people you've worked with before, and you know are good, or people your colleagues and friends have worked with before, who you trust when they say that someone is good.	there are other unfair advantages an applicant might have (being tall, white, male, etc.).	0	18

Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.	How could such a subjective view as the superiority of a cut of three films be argued against?	0	8
some people are willing to be forgiving.	My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.	0	17

I don't think I'm better than the people I'd be denying citizenship	really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault	1	8

Not everybody will make enough that his financial support will outweigh the military support he can provide, this is a definite nuance to my general initial statement though.	If you really want to help, sending money you earn with something you're actually good at (your job) is far more helpful.	1	9
It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.	people are different from you	0	15
