The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment	Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they're antisocial, even when they're around people	0
When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success.	It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is.	0
most of us wouldn't describe them as "delusional" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they've been practiced for centuries.	Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.	1
the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more.	It's wonderful because I can let it all out	0
I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...	This would eventually make the human race smarter	1
assuming they all die	Helping others doesn't matter	1
some people may answer to you that there is not much to be optimistic about in this world and that maybe you are delusional/uninformed to think otherwise	I'd say 4chan will open your eyes and show you Reality on many topics.	1
But being an engineer, I just want to focus on the technology.	At what point do your rules against networking kick in?	0
The "number of mental retardation" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too,	instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever	0

whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)	there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming	1
Laws have to be made with a working knowledge of the system and their language will reflect that.	many laws regulate things that are simply far too complex to simplify to that level	1
I'm showing some of what I truly believe.	When I receive a compliment I should publicly recognize that then, right?	1
THAT would be claiming superiority over foreigners.	not morally superior, but makes more sense.	1
For most religions, it matters what you do	The emphasis on belief rather than practice	1
On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof	It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.	0

See my user history for reference	I think you are still oversimplifying it.	1
As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries.	I understand why politics use this slogan	1
therefore passed down by parents	Intelligence is at least partially genetic	1
Sure, you *could* use a robot to clean your house, but do you want people to think you are poor?	In short, in a world where the cost of physical goods is near zero, the only way to show off your wealth is to hire a bunch of people as a status symbol.	1
they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality	I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans	1
Rwanda wasn't that long ago either	I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east	1
And these slogans don't even denote any sense of superiority over a foreign country, just a preference for your own country.	Patriotism simply says "America is a good country. its not the best, and it might be better or worse than other countries, but i still love and respect it".	0
It is simply not our place or responsibility to carry other countries' burdens.	Americans are the shining example of civil people in the world and everyone else is filthy and brutish and doesn't deserve entry here".	0
Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.	After the horrors of World War 2	0
Whatever way you think you can make yourself useful.	I count that towards 'being on the Ukrainian border, driving back Russians'	1
Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they don't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount?	But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing	0
These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.	I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.	1
just sit on their land charging whatever damn price they want.	I doubt it is a criticism of capitalism in general.	1
if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.	Perhaps this is a bad analogy	1
I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not.	It went - well, okay, I guess.	0

It helps with flexibility	People have different goals	0
You could have actually posed consequences to change my view	That was the entire point of my CMV	1
Allowing networking to influence a hiring decision is not dependent on cultural bias and may be safely exorcised from the hiring process to render it more fair	Networking is discriminatory.	1

it's "true" or not and that "truth" is available to us in an absolute way	The attitude of human value as "what they [potentially] contributed to me/Exxon Mobile" is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit.	1
Egg bearing animals, however, seem to be [as old as the dinosuars]	If we are being really technical, we can confidently say that the egg came first.	1
You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around	The emphasis on belief rather than practice	1
When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem.	their poison should be kept out of the minds of children	1
Perhaps some facets of these historical religions were based off of a desire to justify actions that the original practitioners would have done anyway	e.g. how much of the violence perpetrated by Wahabist Islamists is based off of true religious fanaticism	1
It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view	you aren't looking to have your view changed	1
If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too	If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else,	0
well that's your own gullibility.	Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity.	0
If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too	Most folks don't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them	1

A "standard" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position and merits relevant to that position.	This is a failing of the existing job application paradigm, not an excuse to circumvent it in order to make the process easier.	0
For example, internet trolls work on the basis of causing as much fuss and attention as possible while often remaining anonymous.	I don't see it as one wanting to gain some type of status from it attached to themselves, but instead the gratification of having others pleasure themselves to their nudity.	1
If we`re using a level of "dark" of the level of Brave Little Toaster then why did things like The Iron Giant and Land Before Time get a ton of love associated with them.	There have been a great many "dark" animated movies and shows that grew to become extremely famous.	1
This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion	this intellectual has blessed me with correcting my false facts! I should be thankful!	0

that phenomenon has been around forever	equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech,	0
From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior, but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder.	Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.	1
First, take criminal law.	I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially.	1

How can he prove he's a firefighter?	I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.	1
I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder	which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why	0

Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience	It's Dunning-Kruger	0
the dividing line between species is quite arbitrary	if scientists had enough evidence a distinction would be made.	1
How can you even compare them?	its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow.	0

I've got a friend I've worked with for years.	At what point do your rules against networking kick in?	0
I think you are misinterpreting their motives.	I strongly, strongly doubt they believe that in doing so, they are making great strides in improving conditions for animals.	1
However this isn't about being just a bit conservative.	It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.	0
instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever	And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for "da murder" if we were to take that route in the first place.	1

Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this.	I think you are still oversimplifying it.	1

"33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more."	Pregnancy is hard on the body and far riskier than an abortion performed within a few weeks.	0
Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous	I don't disagree	1
It would also make sense if I was building a school in African but wasn't vegan.	If I was doing absolutely nothing to aid any of the values I believe in, then it wouldn't make any sense however.	1
However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense.	We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory).	0
the stupid and shallow premises would remain untouched	I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism (no offense)	0

If the quality of life is higher, you'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they'd like	I also don't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the "don't think too much" mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist claims you're making	1
when they find a safe hiding place or cover they have a chance getting themselves in a position where they can use the paralyzer on the attacker.

The appliances that have their parts ripped out, are effectively a commentary on black market organ sales.	The fact that it's underrated largely stems from the fact that by today's measure it's far from a children's movie, which unfortunately in western countries is generally the target demographic for animated features.	1

This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected.	There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society.	0

If you stick to the tried and true model they've had, you're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales.

They're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences	the reason people are highly sensitive [emotionally] is the same reason you'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor	1
